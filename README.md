 # ACM Compliance Pest Control Website

Welcome to the ACM Compliance Pest Control website! This project was developed to establish a strong online presence for our new and dynamic pest control company. As we venture into the market, this website will serve as a central hub for potential customers to learn about our services, contact us, and understand our commitment to pest management and compliance.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind**: We've utilized the Tailwind CSS framework to ensure a sleek and responsive design that adapts well to various devices and screen sizes. Tailwind's utility-first approach allowed us to quickly style components and maintain consistency throughout the website.

- **TypeScript**: By incorporating TypeScript into our development workflow, we've added a layer of static typing that enhances code reliability and maintainability. This helps catch potential issues during development and provides better code documentation.

- **React**: The website is built using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React's component-based structure allowed us to create modular and reusable UI elements, resulting in a more organized codebase.

## Deployment

The ACM Compliance Pest Control website is live and accessible via [Vercel](https://vercel.com). Vercel provides an easy and efficient deployment process, ensuring that updates to the website can be published seamlessly. Our deployment setup guarantees a smooth user experience and minimal downtime.
